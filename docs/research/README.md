read-when: You need the evidence/citations behind a roadmap decision, or you're implementing a phase and want the concrete library names, code patterns, and source URLs.

# Research briefs (2025–2026)

These six briefs are the cited evidence base for `UPGRADE-ROADMAP.md`. Each is AI-legible:
findings → concrete skeleton recommendation → source URL. When implementing a phase, read
the matching brief first so you copy the _verified current_ pattern, not a guess.
